<h1>FIRST Robotics Competition (2013)</h1>
<p>FPHS TSA and Robotics club competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition (or FRC, for short). Every year, FIRST provides a new game. After the game is announced, teams have 6 weeks to build their robot. Our team number is 3781, our team name is the "4-H Penny-bots". You can look at more information on our team at our team's <a href="http://firstteam3781.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013, the FRC game was called Ultimate Ascent, and was similar to Ultimate Frisbee meets a jungle gym.</p>

<p>In our 2013 season, we competed at the Seattle regional. Our placing was 31st place out of 64 teams total. This was our first year building at Franklin Pierce High School, and we feel we did an outstanding job.</p>
